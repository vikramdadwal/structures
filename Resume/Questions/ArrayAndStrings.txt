[1]. Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

27. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

28. Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

[29]. Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvB-Ns_TVis] 

30. Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.


31. Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.


32. Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.


33. Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

34. Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

[36] Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of 2


[37]. Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RQ5ADUKHsY&list=PLi9RQVmJD2fYXgBAUfaN5MXgYPUTbzqeb&index=40]

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "race a car"
Output: false


[38]. Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:

Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZNrXG4VqzA]

[39] Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Jq8Ibg2Ys]

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true

40 You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

 

Example 1:

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["racecar","racecar","race"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
